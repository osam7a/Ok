You tried pickpocket someone, but he punched you in the face,
You found some money on the ground, but the police saw you taking it,
You tripped into a lady and stole her bag, but somehow she knows karate and kicked your a$$,
You stole some cash from the bar, but the security cameras caught you,
You sneaked out and stole your dad's wallet, but your mom saw you and grounded you for a week,
You stole some money from the locker in the gym, but turns out that locker is for the strongest guy there, R.I.P,
